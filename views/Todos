# Goals today

* Use express/mocha to create acfuller-wireless
* design new synmed build process
  - Really think through the idea of creating a synmed view in sproutcore
  - and allow the pharmacist to see it, then submit the synmed data to
  - couchbase for storage

  - when batch is built we pull the baskets from couchbase and push to batcher.
  - need to build synmed files at time of scrub before sent to GRx for dispense.

  - need to also look at entry point for labels and documentation.

  ----
  Need to work through inventory process of 28 days supply.
